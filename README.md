## 🤖 AI Training Projects Repository
This repository serves as a collection of my Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning training projects, primarily developed using **Google Colab notebooks** ($`.ipynb` files).

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
The core of this repository consists of the Colab notebooks, where the code, experiments, and results for each project are documented.

* **Jupyter Notebooks:** Each project is contained within one **Jupyter Notebooks** (viewable directly on GitHub). These notebooks typically include:
* Data loading and preprocessing steps.
* Model architecture definition and training loops.
* Evaluation metrics and result visualizations (if needed).

## 🚀 How to View and Run the Projects
Since these projects were developed in Google Colab, the easiest way to explore and re-run them is by opening the notebooks directly in the Colab environment.

### 1. View on GitHubYou can simply click on any $`.ipynb` file in the repository to view its rendered content directly on GitHub.

### 2. Open in Google Colab (Recommended) To run the code, make modifications, or utilize Google's free GPU/TPU resources, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the desired notebook file (e.g., `MNIST.ipynb`).
2. Click the **"Open in Colab"** badge/link (if present at the top of the notebook) or go to the Colab website and upload the notebook from your GitHub repository.

## ✨ Technologies Used
The projects in this repository utilize a variety of popular AI and data science libraries:

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **Google Colab:** The integrated development environment (IDE) for training and execution.
* **Frameworks:** **TensorFlow** / **PyTorch** (depending on the project).
* **Libraries:** **torch**, **torchvision** , etc.
